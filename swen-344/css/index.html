	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements

			<h3>About the Story</h3>
			<p><img src="book-cover.jpg" class="textpic" id="book-cover-pic" alt="First Edition Cover">The War of the Worlds has two parts, Book One: The Coming of the Martians and Book Two: The Earth under the Martians. The unnamed narrator, a philosophically inclined author, struggles to return to his wife while seeing the Martians lay waste to the southern country outside London. Book One also imparts the experience of his brother, also unnamed, who describes events as they deteriorate in the capital, forcing him to escape the Martian onslaught by boarding a paddle steamer near Tillingham, on the Essex coast.</p>

			<p>The plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British Imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears and prejudices. At the time of publication, it was classified as a scientific romance, like Wells' earlier novel The Time Machine. The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never gone out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It has even influenced the work of scientists, notably Robert Hutchings Goddard.</p>
			
			<h3>Excerpt from Chapter 4: The Cylinder Opens</h3>
			<p>I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active.</p>

			<p>"He's fallen in the pit!" cried some one.</p>

			<p>"Keep back!" said several.</p>

			<p>The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.</p>

			<p>"I say!" said Ogilvy; "help keep these idiots back.  We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you know!"</p>

			<p>I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in.</p>

			<p>The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes.</p>

			<p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: grayish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.</p>

			<p>A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards. I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.</p>

			<p>A big grayish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p>

			<h3>About <abbr title="Herbert George">H. G.</abbr> Wells</h3>
			<p> Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) — known as H. G. Wells — was a prolific English writer in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, and social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels, and Wells is called a father of science fiction. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898).</p>

			<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Herbert_George_Wells_in_1943.jpg" class="textpic" id="hg-wells-pic" alt="Picture of H.G. Wells">Wells's earliest specialized training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathizing with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist. Novels like Kipps and The History of Mr Polly, which describe lower-middle class life, led to the suggestion, when they were published, that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole.</p>
			
			<p>He was born at Atlas House, 46 High Street, Bromley, in Kent, on 21 September 1866. Called "Bertie" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former domestic servant). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meager income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team. Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.</p>

			<p>A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he started reading books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.</p>

			<p>No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the Southsea Drapery Emporium, Hyde's. His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices, later inspired his novels The Wheels of Chance and Kipps, which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.</p>

			<p>Wells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a Protestant and his father a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. Fortunately for Herbert, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato's Republic, and More's Utopia. This would be the beginning of Herbert George Wells's venture into literature.</p>
